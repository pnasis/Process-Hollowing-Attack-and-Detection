# Process Hollowing Attack and Detection

## üìå What is Process Hollowing?
Process hollowing is a **code injection technique** where a legitimate process is created in a suspended state and its memory is replaced with malicious code. The goal is to **evade security solutions** by making malicious code execute under the guise of a legitimate process.

Attackers often use this technique for **stealthy malware execution**, such as launching a trojanized version of `notepad.exe` while actually running a backdoor or a remote access trojan (RAT).

---

## üî• Exploitation Phases
The process hollowing technique consists of **several key steps**:

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Suspended Process**
The attacker creates a new process (e.g., `notepad.exe`) in a **suspended state** using `CreateProcessA()` or `CreateProcessW()`.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Unmap the Process Memory**
The attack code uses `NtUnmapViewOfSection()` to remove the legitimate executable code from memory while keeping the process structure intact.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Allocate New Memory for Malicious Code**
Using `VirtualAllocEx()`, the attacker allocates memory in the suspended process and writes malicious shellcode into it.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Write Malicious Code to Target Process**
The attacker writes the malicious payload into the allocated memory using `WriteProcessMemory()`.

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Set Entry Point and Resume Execution**
By modifying the **entry point** in the process's **PEB (Process Environment Block)**, the malware ensures execution starts from its injected code. The process is then resumed using `ResumeThread()`.

## YARA Rule for Detecting Process Hollowing

```yara
rule process_hollowing {
    meta:
        description = "Detects process hollowing attempt"
        author = "Prodromos - Anargyros Nasis"
        date = "2025-03-10"
        reference = "Process Hollowing - https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/012/"
        severity = "high"
        mitre_attack = "T1055, T1055.012, T1106, T1204.002"
    strings:
        $api1 = "CreateProcessA" nocase
        $api2 = "VirtualAllocEx" nocase
        $api3 = "WriteProcessMemory" nocase
        $api4 = "CreateRemoteThread" nocase
    condition:
        (uint16(0) == 0x5A4D) and all of them
}
```
