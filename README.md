# Process Hollowing Attack and Detection

## üìå What is Process Hollowing?
Process hollowing is a **code injection technique** where a legitimate process is created in a suspended state and its memory is replaced with malicious code. The goal is to **evade security solutions** by making malicious code execute under the guise of a legitimate process.

Attackers often use this technique for **stealthy malware execution**, such as launching a trojanized version of `notepad.exe` while actually running a backdoor or a remote access trojan (RAT).

---

## üî• Exploitation Phases
The process hollowing technique consists of **several key steps**:

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Suspended Process**
The attacker creates a new process (e.g., `notepad.exe`) in a **suspended state** using `CreateProcessA()` or `CreateProcessW()`.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Allocate New Memory for Malicious Code**
Using `VirtualAllocEx()`, the attacker allocates memory in the suspended process and writes malicious shellcode into it.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Write Malicious Code to Target Process**
The attacker writes the malicious payload into the allocated memory using `WriteProcessMemory()`.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Set Entry Point and Resume Execution**
By modifying the **entry point** in the process's **PEB (Process Environment Block)**, the malware ensures execution starts from its injected code. The process is then resumed using `ResumeThread()`.

## YARA Rule for Detecting Process Hollowing

```yara
rule process_hollowing {
    meta:
        description = "Detects process hollowing attempt"
        author = "Prodromos - Anargyros Nasis"
        date = "2025-03-10"
        reference = "Process Hollowing - https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/012/"
        severity = "high"
        mitre_attack = "T1055, T1055.012, T1106, T1204.002"
    strings:
        $api1 = "CreateProcessA" nocase
        $api2 = "NtQueryInformationProcess" nocase
        $api3 = "VirtualAllocEx" nocase
        $api4 = "WriteProcessMemory" nocase
        $api5 = "CreateRemoteThread" nocase
    condition:

}

## How to Use

### **1. Compile the Code**
```bash
gcc poc/process_hollowing.c -o process_hollowing.exe
```

### **2. Run the Process Hollowing Program**
```bash
process_hollowing.exe
```

### **3. Use YARA to Detect the Technique**
```bash
yara -r rules/proc_hollow.yar .
```

### **4. Use Sigma to Detect the Technique**
```bash
sigmac -t windows rules/proc_hollow.yml | elastalert-test-rule --debug
```

### **5. Monitor with Sigma (Using a SIEM or Splunk)**
Upload `proc_hollow.yml` to your SIEM tool to detect suspicious behavior.
